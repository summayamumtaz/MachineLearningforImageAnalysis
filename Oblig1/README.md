# KNN Classifier and Softmax Classifier implementation

This is the implementation of  a KNN-classifier and a Softmax-classifier in the style of a neural net, using the softmax score function, the cross entropy loss function and updating weights by using stochastic gradient descent and taking in a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight. 





#### Part 1: Implement a knn classifier and use cross-validation to find the best value of k.
The Jupyter Notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the KNN classifier.



#### Part 2: Implement a softmax classifier as a multiclass extension to logistic regression.
The Jupyter notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of the softmax classifier.

### Download data:
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset. Run the following from the main directory of the code:
